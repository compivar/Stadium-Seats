## Overview
### Description
The first screen will show a map of the stadiums in your area. Clicking on a stadium will take you to another screen that shows you all the home games for that stadium in a scroll view. Selecting a date will take you to the seating chart for the stadium. Selecting a seat will show you the view from the seat, and take you to the checkout where you pay.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Ticket Purchasing App for Entertainment
- **Mobile:** App uses your map location, shows you real-time seating
- **Story:** Users are able to share pictures of the view from the seats.
- **Market:** This app will be intended for the biggest professional sports organizations, so the market is for sports fans.
- **Habit:** Users would use this app every once in a while when the want to attend a sport event. The average user would just concume this app.
- **Scope:** I am not sure how I could get live updates of the seat availability in a stadium, but I think the rest of app is doable in seven weeks. I think my product is clearly defined.
